- Need to check content completeness, not just file existence

### 📊 Verification Progress:
- **Verified**: 27 files (16 properly migrated + 11 fixed)
- **Fixed Critical Issues**: 11 files  
- **Success Rate**: 50% properly migrated, 50% had significant issues
- **Remaining to verify**: ~20 files

**CURRENT ASSESSMENT**: The migration has mixed results. Some files are properly migrated while others had severe content loss. The issues appear to be with automated conversion tools that failed to handle complex RST syntax, code blocks, and cross-references properly.

### 🔧 Strategy:
1. **Continue manual verification** of remaining files
2. **Fix content issues** as they are discovered
3. **Focus on technical documentation** (security, hub) which are most critical
4. **Verify cross-references** work correctly after content fixes
