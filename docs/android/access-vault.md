# Working with Vaults

This section shows you how to work with a vault like view its content, move files or access it with other applications.

## Unlock Vault {#unlock-vault}

If you want to access the data inside a vault, you have to unlock it by selecting it.

<img src="/img/android/unlock-vault-0-select.png" alt="How to unlock a vault with Android" width="346" />

In the next step, you have to unlock the vault using the password. If the device supports fingerprint authentication and you've activated it in the settings for this vault, you will be prompted to unlock using fingerprint. How to setup fingerprint authentication will be documented in a separate chapter.

<img src="/img/android/unlock-vault-2-using-fingerprint.png" alt="How to unlock a vault with Android" width="346" />

After providing the credentials, the vault gets unlocked and opened.

You're now able to edit the content of the vault.

## Lock Vault {#lock-vault}

To lock an unlocked vault, there are several ways to do this:

* use the lock button in the vault list ①
* use the lock button in the notification ②
* use the lock button in the vault actions ③ and ④

## View and Edit File {#view-and-edit-file}

Start the view and edit process by clicking on a file.
Finish the editing or viewing using the back button of the device until you're back in Cryptomator.
If the content has changed, the upload process starts.

## Search in Folder {#search-in-folder}

Search for files or folders within the same folder using the magnifier ①.

<img src="/img/android/search-0-start.png" alt="How to search in a vault with Android" width="346" />

Now you can enter the pattern after which you want to search in this folder.

<img src="/img/android/search-1-searched.png" alt="How to search in a vault with Android" width="346" />

Using the `X` ② you can clear the pattern and after pressing it again, the filter mode is finished.

<img src="/img/android/search-2-finish.png" alt="How to search in a vault with Android" width="346" />

In the settings there are two options that influence the behavior of the search:

* Live search (disbaled by default)
* Search using glob pattern matching (disbaled by default)

For more information, see the Settings chapter.

## Sort Folder by… {#sort-folder-by}

<img src="/img/android/sort.gif" alt="How to sort the content of a folder with Android" width="346" />

## Fast scroll {#fast-scroll}

<img src="/img/android/fast-scroll.gif" alt="How to scroll fast through the content of a folder with Android" width="346" />

If the folder contents are sorted by file size, the preview will show the file sizes accordingly. The same applies to the modification date.
